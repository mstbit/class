A patient bursts into a doctor's office, "Doctor, I believe I'm a deck of cards!" 
The doctor calmly replies, "Go sit in the waiting room, please, I'll be dealing with you later."

A snowman sniffs, "Hm, funny, I smell carrots..."

Two young fortune tellers meet on the dock at the start of a cruise. One says, "We're really going to 
have a fun time on this trip."  The other responds happily: "Yes it reminds me of the one we'll take
next year."
